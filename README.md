OK here is thse setup:

There is only one name in this accession list. 
Run it a bunch of times. 
So that one face is everywhere. 
Need to fix whatever idiocy I did with the js so the autoplay works again. 
Then another instance of accession will run as a different user with a facial recognition software
there should only be one face that is predominent in this Data
especially by repeating over and over again the same signature
so just run accession many times
then I shoulds be able to say 1) this is a face 2) this is the #1 face 3) this is her name
I think this is reasonably straightforward. 

There is an important factor here regarding the interaction of multiple users, so like
so basically the tags get counted, there is the #1 with the tag
a different versiosn reads everything but without a Tag
then it feeds back into a system
this is how a ML/AI/Robot system is integrated to recognize then see
ok the facial recognition system will say, oh I have the most images tagged with this facial signature
then it checks for the largest # of tags and says oh
THAT Signature belongs to THAT face

makes cents

so there make a small adjustment to the Artwork going into the Museum
so this will overwhelm the system and make it extremely easy to see which Face came out on Top
there might be a Puppy in there too

OK this data set should do it

now I have to do Front End work sigh usually I have people for that

ACTUALLY a thought occured have some sister pics in there too, can do mainline identification then similarity metrics
